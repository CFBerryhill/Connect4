Welcome to Casey's Connect 4!

This is a research project to learn about different methods of playing 2 player non-random competitve strategy games.
Connect 4 was the game of choice.

There are a few available modes to play the game

Human vs Human (on a standard board)                 - option 0 on main menu
Human vs Artificial Agent (on a standard board)      - option 1 on main menu
Run tests via the testconfig.txt                     - option 2 on main menu
Artificial Agent vs Artifical Agent (variable board) - option 3 on main menu

The PDF of the associated paper for this project will available in the repo for the interested.
